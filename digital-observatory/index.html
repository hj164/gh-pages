They want to expand their partnerships with universities in Asia. This project is a pilot study to understand how education partnerships form between universities and cultural organisations in Western and developing countries. I analysed how transnational curatorial education develop within emerging cultural centres, particularly in China, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. </p><h6>Goal</h6><p>Map out the landscape of transnational education in 3 months of project cycle. Develop a report that offers adivce on partnership research and development.</p><h6>My Role</h6><ul><li>In-depth interviews &amp; analysis</li><li>Policy research</li><li>Report writing </li></ul><h3>Methods</h3><h6>Policy Review</h6><p>I started by developing a spreadsheet covering current higher education programmes about museums and heritage at branch campuses of Western universities. I analysed institutional policy documents relating to their partners and course development.</p><h6>Semi-structured Interview</h6><p>From 30 education programmes analysed, I identified 7 case studies and conducted 8 semi-structured interviews with selected participants. This informed strategies for their future partnership-building.</p><h3>Key Insights</h3><ul><li>Three types of transnational partnerships identified: branch campus, joint degree programmes, and professional training programmes.</li><li>Transnational education strengthened partnerships between universities, as well as between universities and local museums.</li><li>Local organisations had limited ownership of education programmes because most of the curriculum development was led by the Western institutions.</li><li>The pandemic, miscommunications, and different organisational cultures and policies posed significant challenges in partnership management.</li></ul><h3>Impact</h3><p>We delivered a report that presented the landscape of transnational collaborations between universities, governments and cultural organisations in China and the Middle East.</p><p>Our report was featuerd in a panel discussion at the Anthropology and Education Conference 2024 (Royal Anthropological Institute, London). Our findings secured a funding for future development of the project.</p><p> </p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><div class="post__share"></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://hj164.github.io/gh-pages/x/" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> About Me </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://hj164.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by Publii</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://hj164.github.io/gh-pages/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="https://hj164.github.io/gh-pages/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
