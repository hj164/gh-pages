They planned to establish research hubs in different regions. I acted as a research assistant to pilot a study that paved the way for the first hub, the \"Digital Culture Observatory\". It reviewed existing research strategies on digital activities in cultural institutions, and envisioned a series of future-oriented policies and strategies.</p>\n<h6>Goal</h6>\n<p>To review the current landscape of cross-sectoral and cross-institutional research collaborations within cultural institutions. As one of the Institute's first research projects with their partners, the goal is to pave the way for establishing the Observatory - a research hub dedicated to digital culture in Australia.</p>\n<h6>My Role</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>Strategic analysis &amp; development</li>\n<li>Literature review¬†</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Methods</h3>\n<h6>Scoping Review</h6>\n<p>I led a review of research strategies related to technology R&amp;D in 30+ cultural institutions, examining their outputs and impact.¬†Using insights garnered from this exploration, the team formulated practical guidelines for both practice and action research tailored to cultural institutions in Australia.</p>\n<h3>Key Insights</h3>\n<p>Based on the scoping review, I developed a taxonomy of human-centred research strategies:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Practice-based Research</strong> fosters co-creation and experimentation in museums.</li>\n<li><strong>Applied Research</strong> uses evidence-informed evaluation to drive the development of impactful solutions, creating tangible benefits for individuals and communities in the long term.</li>\n<li><strong>Participatory Research</strong> promotes community engagement and social change. It is the fundation of human-centred research .</li>\n<li><strong>Innovative Research Translation</strong> challenges conventional research strategies. Using multisensory technologies as creative mediums, it expands the accessibility and reach of research outcomes.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Impact¬†</h3>\n<p class=\"whitespace-pre-wrap\">The research supported Monash University and the Australian National University in curating a seminar series that built digital research capacity. It initiated partnerships between the Institute for Digital Culture and Australian cultural sectors.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--full\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://hj164.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/3/photo-1497409988347-cbfaac2f0b12-2.avif\" alt=\"\" width=\"2070\" height=\"1380\"></figure>",

I research and design the human side of digital transformation.</strong></p>\n<p>When I was a curator intern, I uncovered a lot of biased legacy data in the collection database.

Industries rapidly adopted these technological solutions without considering their implications. These include organisations with traditional business models, where implementing new technology is often considered ‚Äúchallenging‚Äù.

They want to expand their partnerships with universities in Asia. This project is a pilot study to understand how education partnerships form between universities and cultural organisations in Western and developing countries. I analysed how transnational curatorial education develop within emerging cultural centres, particularly in China, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia.¬†</p>\n<h6>Goal</h6>\n<p>Map out the landscape of transnational education in 3 months of project cycle. Develop a report that offers adivce on partnership research and development.</p>\n<h6>My Role</h6>\n<ul>\n<li>In-depth interviews &amp; analysis</li>\n<li>Policy research</li>\n<li>Report writing¬†</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Methods</h3>\n<h6>Policy Review</h6>\n<p>I started by developing a spreadsheet covering current higher education programmes about museums and heritage at branch campuses of Western universities. I analysed institutional policy documents relating to their partners and course development.</p>\n<h6>Semi-structured Interview</h6>\n<p>From 30 education programmes analysed, I identified 7 case studies and conducted 8 semi-structured interviews with selected participants. This informed strategies for their future partnership-building.</p>\n<h3>Key Insights</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Three types of transnational partnerships identified: branch campus, joint degree programmes, and professional training programmes.</li>\n<li>Transnational education strengthened partnerships between universities, as well as between universities and local museums.</li>\n<li>Local organisations had limited ownership of education programmes because most of the curriculum development was led by the Western institutions.</li>\n<li>The pandemic, miscommunications, and different organisational cultures and policies posed significant challenges in partnership management.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Impact</h3>\n<p>We delivered a report that presented the landscape of transnational collaborations between universities, governments and cultural organisations in China and the Middle East.</p>\n<p>Our report was featuerd in a panel discussion at the Anthropology and Education Conference 2024 (Royal Anthropological Institute, London). Our findings secured a funding for future development of the project.</p>\n<p>¬†</p>",
